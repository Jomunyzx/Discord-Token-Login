# Discord Token Login Script

This Python script allows you to log into Discord using a token, while ensuring that your ChromeDriver is compatible with your installed Chrome version. If ChromeDriver is not present or does not match, the script provides a direct download link for the correct version.

## Features

- **Token-Based Discord Login**: Automate logging into Discord using your token.
- **ChromeDriver Version Detection**: Automatically checks the installed version of Google Chrome and ChromeDriver.
- **Automatic ChromeDriver Download Links**: Provides direct download links for the correct ChromeDriver version if it's missing or incompatible.
- **Error Handling**: The script displays error messages only when actual errors occur, ensuring smooth operation.

## Requirements

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**: Download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Google Chrome**: Make sure Google Chrome is installed and up to date.
- **ChromeDriver**: The script will automatically handle ChromeDriver compatibility, but you can download it from [here](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/).
